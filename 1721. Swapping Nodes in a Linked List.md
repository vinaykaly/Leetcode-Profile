# You are given the head of a linked list, and an integer k. Return the head of the linked list after swapping the values of the kth node from the beginning and the kth node from the end (the list is 1-indexed).


```
Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]

Example 2:

Input: head = [7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5], k = 5
Output: [7,9,6,6,8,7,3,0,9,5]

```

## Algorithm

1. Start with head of the linkedlist.  
    * node1 and node2 both point to the head initially.


2. Find the kth node from the beginning(node1).  
    * Move forward k steps to reach kth node (linked List in this problem is 1 based index)  


3. Find the kth node from the end(node2).  
    * Use temporary pointer (temp)  to keep  moving from node1 to end of the list.
    * for every step temp moves, move node2 one step forward.
    * when temp reaches the end of the list,node2 will point to the kth node from last.
   

4. Swap the values of the two Kth nodes (node1 and node2)
    * Swap the values stored in node1 and node2.

5. return the head of the linked List.


```python
class Solution:
    def swapNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]: 
    
            node1=node2=head  
            
            for i in range(1,k):
            
                    node1 = node1.next 
            
            temp = node1
            while temp.next:

                node2 = node2.next

                temp = temp.next

            node1.val,node2.val = node2.val,node1.val

            return head
