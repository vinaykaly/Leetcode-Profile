1. This approch is  more efficient than sorting both strings and comparing each char.
2. Time complexity is O(n) and Space complexity O(1).




```python
s1 = "aabaa"; s2 = "baaaaa"

if len(s1) != len(s2):
    
    print(False)
    
else:
    
    a = [0]*26
    
    for i,j in zip(s1,s1):
        
        a[ord(i)-ord('a')] += 1
        a[ord(j)-ord('a')] -= 1
        
    print(all([ c == 0 for c in a]))

```
