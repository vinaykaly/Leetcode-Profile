**Algorithm: Reverse Odd Levels of a Binary Tree**
1. Initialize Variables:

* Start at the root of the binary tree.
* Use a queue (deque) to traverse the tree level by level.
* Keep track of the current level using a variable level, starting at 0.
2. Level-Order Traversal:

* Use a while loop to process each level of the tree until the queue is empty.
* For each level: 
  * Determine the number of nodes at that level (level_len) by checking the current size of the queue.
3. Reverse Odd Levels:

* If the current level is odd (i.e., level % 2 == 1):
  * Use two pointers (low and high) to iterate through the nodes in the queue for that level.
* Swap the val of the nodes at the low and high positions until the two pointers meet.
4. Expand the Queue for the Next Level:

* Process all nodes at the current level by:
  * Dequeuing each node from the front of the queue.
  * Enqueuing its left and right children (if they exist) to the back of the queue.
5. Increment the Level:

* After processing all nodes at the current level, increment the level variable.
6. Return the Modified Tree:

* After all levels have been processed, return the root of the tree.

class Solution:
    def reverseOddLevels(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        
        d = deque([root])
        
        level = 0
        
        while d:
            
            level_len = len(d)  # to know number of nodes in each level
            
            if level % 2 == 1:
                
                low = 0
                
                high = level_len-1
                
                while low < high:
                    
                    d[low].val,d[high].val = d[high].val,d[low].val
                    
                    low += 1
                    high  -= 1
                    
                    
                    
            
            for i in range(level_len):
                
                x = d.popleft()
                
                if x.left:
                    
                    d.append(x.left)

                    d.append(x.right)
                    
                    
            
            level += 1
