### Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.

```
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4]
Explanation: [4,9] is also accepted.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        s = nums1 & nums2
        
        return list(s)

```

## How it works

**When you use the expression s = set(nums1) & set(nums2), Python performs the following steps internally:**

#### Process

1. Determine which of the two sets is smaller.
2. Iterate over the elements in smaller set.
3. For each element in smaller set, check if it exists in the hash table of the larger set.
4. if element found in both sets, include in the result.
5. A new set is created to hold the result of the intersection.
6. This set contains only the elements that are present in both set1 and set2.
