Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries I. Click on the link to view the [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-after-road-addition-queries-i/description/)

### Python

1. Declare a adj list which contains adjacency nodes ex [1,2,3,4] 0th index contains 1 1th index contains 2 ....
2. iterate through the queries and append destination node to the adj[src]
3. call the shortest path function
4. in this code I am  using BFS algorithm so use deque
5. initially deque contain (0,0) which is node and length respectively

```python
from collections import deque
n = 4; queries = [[0,3],[0,2]]

adj = [[i+1] for i in range(n)]

def shortest_path():
    
    q = deque()
    
    q.append((0,0))
    visit = set()
    
    visit.add(0)
    
    while q:
        
        cur,length = q.popleft()
        
        if cur == n-1:
            
            return length
        
        else:
            
            for nei in adj[cur]:
                
                if nei not in visit:
                    
                    q.append((nei,length+1))
                    
                    visit.add(nei)
    

res = []

for src,des in queries:
    
    adj[src].append(des)
    
    res.append(shortest_path())
    

print(res)

```
