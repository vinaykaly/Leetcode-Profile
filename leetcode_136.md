## Python
```python

def singleNumber(nums):

      res = 0
      for i in nums:
          res = res^i
      return res

singleNumber([4,1,2,1,2])
```
## Output
```
4
```
## Explaination

##### NOTE -> As we see from the question except one element, remaining elements repeats twice. Above code won't work  if element's are  repeats odd number of times.

 let us understand XOR(^) operator

 if two bit's are same then it is set to  0 and if bit's are different set to 1.

### print(2^2) -> 0
because binary number of 2 is  **0010**

0010 -> 2  
0010 -> 2

0000 -> 0 --------- equation1

compare each bit from right to left , result will be 0 this is how XOR(^) operator works

binary number for 4 is  0100

### print(equation1 ^ 4)  

0000 -> 0  
0100 -> 4  

---------   
0100 -> 4

this how above code works
