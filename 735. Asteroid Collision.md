Asteroid Collision. Click on the link to view the [Question](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/description/)

1. For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.
2. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.
3. the while loop condition is stack not to be empty and current element should be less than last element.
4. if current element is less than (stack[-1]--> positive) then check for the condition if abs(i) > stack[-1] then pop the last element in stack and continue the loop.
5. elif i current element is equal to the last element then pop the last element and break the loop.
6. if current element is less than last element the cursor reaches to the break statement and notthing is alter in stack.


```python
asteroids = []

stack = []

for i in asteroids: 
    
    while stack and i < 0 < stack[-1]:   # i is positive then it won't enter into loop because i greater than 0 vice versa
        
        if stack[-1] < abs(i):
            
            stack.pop()
            
            continue
            
        elif abs(i) == stack[-1]:
            
            stack.pop()
            
        break
        
    else:
        
        stack.append(i)
        
print(stack)

```
